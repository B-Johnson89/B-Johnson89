👋 Hi there, I'm @B-Johnson89, better known as Brian Johnson!

🎖️🇺🇸 I'm an Army veteran, and I'm proud of the experiences and skills I gained while serving our country.

🔒🌐 Now, I'm passionate about Cybersecurity and currently honing my skills at the Coding Dojo. My goal is to make the digital world a safer place for everyone.

🏈🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not busy cracking codes, I'm enjoying a sports game (Go Birds!), working out , or researching a new destination to travel to. I love seeking new adventures in different countries. I have a soft spot for great food and love exploring diverse culinary delights on my travels.

🎸🎤 Live music fuels my soul.

🎞️🍿 Call me old-fashioned, but I still enjoy the magic of the movie theater experience over streaming at home. There's just something about the big screen and the surround sound that can't be replicated!


🤝 I'm eager to collaborate with fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals on projects, research, and discussions. Let's make the internet more secure together!

📬 Want to connect? You can reach me at brianodellj@gmail.com, visit my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-ojohnson/, or send me a message here on GitHub. I'm always open to meeting new people and exploring opportunities.

Thanks for stopping by! 😄
