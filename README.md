👋 Hi there, I'm @B-Johnson89, better known as Brian Johnson!

🎖️🇺🇸 I'm an Army veteran, and I'm proud of the experiences and skills I gained while serving our country.

🔒🌐 I'm passionate about Cybersecurity and have graduated from Coding Dojo Cybersecurity Boot Camp. My goal is to make the digital world a safer place for everyone.

🏈🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not busy with cybersecurity, I enjoy watching sports (Go Birds!), working out, or researching a new destination to travel to. I love seeking new adventures in different countries and exploring diverse culinary delights on my travels.

🤝 I'm eager to collaborate with fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals on projects, research, and discussions. Let's make the internet more secure together!

📬 Want to connect? You can reach me at brianodellj@gmail.com, visit my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-ojohnson/, or message me here on GitHub. I'm always open to meeting new people and exploring opportunities.
